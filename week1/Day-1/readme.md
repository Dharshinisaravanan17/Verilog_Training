Verilog Training – Week 1, Day 1
-------------------
Overview
Day 1 focuses on combinational logic design using Verilog. The main goal is to implement and simulate basic digital circuits: 4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX) and 3-to-8 Decoder.

This day covers:
- Writing Verilog modules using case and conditional statements.
- Creating testbenches for simulation.
- Observing circuit behavior through waveform analysis.
- Using Icarus Verilog 12.0 and EasyEDA Playground for simulation.

Simulation Workflow
-------------------
Tool: Icarus Verilog 12.0

Compile Options:
-Wall -g2012

Run Options:
- Open EPWave after run to view waveform.
  (or)
- Download files after run for local storage or GitHub upload.
-------------------
Notes:
- $dumpfile and $dumpvars used in testbenches to generate .vcd waveform files.
- $monitor prints inputs and outputs during simulation.
- Waveform images demonstrate correct behavior of circuits.
